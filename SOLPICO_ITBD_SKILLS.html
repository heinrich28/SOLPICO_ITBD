                    One of the skills I am most proud of is my ability to debug<sup><b>1</b></sup>. I have always been interested in solving problems, especially when it comes to technology<sup><b>2</b></sup>. Debugging helps identify and fix issues in software or systems<sup><b>3</b></sup>. It was challenging at first, but over time, I’ve learned how to understand how things work and what went wrong<sup><b>4</b></sup>. Debugging requires patience, and I’ve learned to take my time and not rush through it<sup><b>5</b></sup>. It’s like solving a puzzle, where every piece must fit perfectly for everything to work<sup><b>6</b></sup>.

When debugging, I pay close attention to every detail<sup><b>7</b></sup>. In technology, small mistakes can lead to big problems, so I carefully check each line of code and how it interacts with other parts<sup><b>8</b></sup>. I also use different tools to find the issue<sup><b>9</b></sup>. I try various approaches, whether checking error messages or running tests, until I find the root cause<sup><b>10</b></sup>. This skill is vital in software development, and I’ve gotten better at it over time<sup><b>11</b></sup>.

Being a detailed person also helps me when debugging<sup><b>12</b></sup>. I’ve always liked paying attention to the little things, which helps me in many areas of my life<sup><b>13</b></sup>. In technology, the smallest issues can be the hardest to find, so attention to detail is essential<sup><b>14</b></sup>. I take the time to look carefully at systems and check every part of a program<sup><b>15</b></sup>. This mindset has also helped me in school, where I make sure I understand every part of a lesson before moving on<sup><b>16</b></sup>.

When I debug, I break down bigger problems into smaller parts<sup><b>17</b></sup>. This approach helps me focus on each one individually<sup><b>18</b></sup>. I also document my progress to keep track of my work<sup><b>19</b></sup>. This detail-oriented mindset helps me stay organized in everything I do<sup><b>20</b></sup>. It has made me more methodical in solving problems, and I know it will continue to help me in the future<sup><b>21</b></sup>.

In the future, I want to keep improving my debugging skills<sup><b>22</b></sup>. I plan to learn more about programming languages and debugging tools<sup><b>23</b></sup>.

                   Gaming has always been one of my favorite hobbies, but lately, I don't play as much as I used to<sup><b>1</b></sup>. Before, I spent a lot of time playing games like Valorant, Need for Speed, and Red Dead Redemption 2<sup><b>2</b></sup>. It was something I really enjoyed, but now, I find myself playing less often<sup><b>3</b></sup>. Even though I still like gaming, my focus has changed, and I don’t have as much time for it anymore<sup><b>4</b></sup>. I used to play Valorant almost every day, always working on my aim and teamwork<sup><b>5</b></sup>. It was so much fun to play with my friends and feel the excitement of winning<sup><b>6</b></sup>. The game kept me engaged with its fast pace and strategies, but now, I rarely play<sup><b>7</b></sup>. I miss the fun I had, but I just don’t have the time to play as much<sup><b>8</b></sup>. Need for Speed was another game I enjoyed because of my love for cars<sup><b>9</b></sup>. I liked customizing my cars and racing them through different tracks<sup><b>10</b></sup>. The thrill of pushing my car to the limit made it even more exciting<sup><b>11</b></sup>. But now, I don’t play as often because life has gotten busier, and I have other things to focus on<sup><b>12</b></sup>. Red Dead Redemption was a game I enjoyed because it let me experience life in the Wild West<sup><b>13</b></sup>. The story was amazing, and exploring the vast open world felt really real<sup><b>14</b></sup>. But now, I rarely have time to get back into that world<sup><b>15</b></sup>. Although I still appreciate the game, I don’t get the chance to play it like I used to<sup><b>16</b></sup>. In the end, gaming used to be a big part of my life, but now I only play occasionally<sup><b>17</b></sup>. It’s still a great way to relax, but my priorities have changed<sup><b>18</b></sup>. Even though I play less, I’ll always remember the fun moments and adventures from these games<sup><b>19</b></sup>. I might not game as much as before, but when I do, it still brings me joy and helps me unwind<sup><b>20</b></sup>.

                    As I continue learning more about technology, I have become really interested in cybersecurity and QA testing<sup><b>1</b></sup>. My curiosity about computers started when I was young, and I was always amazed by how they worked<sup><b>2</b></sup>. Over time, I became more curious about how systems are managed, secured, and maintained<sup><b>3</b></sup>. Cybersecurity caught my attention because I see how cyberattacks happen everywhere<sup><b>4</b></sup>. I realized how important it is to protect networks, manage user access, and ensure that systems are always secure<sup><b>5</b></sup>. Instead of hacking, I am more interested in the role of an administrator who manages security, updates systems, and prevents cyber threats<sup><b>6</b></sup>.

Aside from cybersecurity, I also got interested in QA testing<sup><b>7</b></sup>. I enjoy checking software for bugs and finding ways to improve it<sup><b>8</b></sup>. QA testing is important because it ensures that applications and systems function properly<sup><b>9</b></sup>. I like testing software and making sure there are no problems before users interact with it<sup><b>10</b></sup>. It requires patience, attention to detail, and problem-solving skills, which I find exciting<sup><b>11</b></sup>. The challenge of making software work smoothly motivates me to learn different testing techniques and tools<sup><b>12</b></sup>.

My interest in cybersecurity and QA testing grew stronger when I learned about how businesses manage their IT infrastructure<sup><b>13</b></sup>. I started researching how system administrators handle security updates, monitor networks, and prevent unauthorized access<sup><b>14</b></sup>. This made me curious about managing servers, firewalls, and database security<sup><b>15</b></sup>. I also got interested in automated testing, which helps software developers find bugs faster<sup><b>16</b></sup>. I believe that both cybersecurity and QA testing are very important today, especially because people rely on technology so much<sup><b>17</b></sup>.

In the future, I want to gain real experience in these fields by working on projects and getting certifications<sup><b>18</b></sup>. I plan to study system administration, network security, and different software testing techniques<sup><b>19</b></sup>. The idea of managing IT systems and ensuring their security excites me<sup><b>20</b></sup>. I know that both fields require continuous learning, and I am willing to do that<sup><b>21</b></sup>. My goal is to help improve the tech industry by keeping systems secure and ensuring that applications run smoothly<sup><b>22</b></sup>. Pursuing cybersecurity and QA testing will allow me to use my curiosity, analytical skills, and problem-solving abilities<sup><b>23</b></sup>. I am excited to keep learning and improving in this field<sup><b>24</b></sup>.
